<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Causal Judge Evaluation (CJE) provides a principled,
practitioner-first framework for turning LLM-as-judge scores into
causally interpretable estimates with honest confidence intervals. This
playbook has covered:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The problem:</strong> Naive averaging of judge scores is
a heuristic that breaks in predictable ways (wrong scale, hidden drift,
no uncertainty, off-policy illusion).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The solution:</strong> Three analysis modes— (on-policy),
Calibrated (off-policy with weights), and Calibrated (off-policy with
critic)—each tailored to common evaluation workflows.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The core methods:</strong> to map scores to outcomes, to
stabilize weights, and to keep CIs honest.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The diagnostics:</strong> Five high-leverage checks
(coverage, reliability, ESS, tail index, orthogonality) that catch the
most important failure modes and point to concrete fixes.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The assumptions:</strong> SUTVA, overlap, oracle
randomness, and judge monotone sufficiency, all checkable via
diagnostics.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The playbook:</strong> Decision trees, workflows,
checklists, troubleshooting, and reporting templates for
operators.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The evidence:</strong> Case studies showing DM, IPS, and
DR in action, with realistic numbers and sensitivity checks.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The limitations:</strong> Judge quality, monotonicity,
overlap, drift, and small oracle slices are the main constraints; most
are addressable with targeted remediations.</p></li>
</ul>

<section id="when-to-use-cje" class="level2">
<h2>When to use CJE</h2>
<p>Use CJE when you need to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Rank candidate policies on a shared prompt set with statistical
rigor.</p></li>
<li><p>Estimate policy values on a meaningful KPI scale (e.g., pass
rate, satisfaction) with confidence intervals.</p></li>
<li><p>Reuse judged logs to assess multiple candidates without
regenerating (off-policy evaluation).</p></li>
<li><p>Combine logged data with fresh draws for tighter CIs and
robustness ().</p></li>
<li><p>Audit and document evaluation assumptions, diagnostics, and
sensitivity checks.</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="what-cje-is-not" class="level2">
<h2>What CJE is not</h2>
<p>CJE is not:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A replacement for A/B testing. Use CJE for rapid offline
iteration; validate winners with online tests when stakes are
high.</p></li>
<li><p>A fix for poor judges. If the judge is biased or unreliable,
calibration cannot save you.</p></li>
<li><p>A method for sequential or adaptive settings (multi-turn
conversations with context dependence). Extensions are possible but
beyond this playbook.</p></li>
<li><p>A universal solution. When assumptions fail and cannot be fixed,
CJE may not apply. In such cases, report limitations
transparently.</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="best-practices" class="level2">
<h2>Best practices</h2>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Design for paired comparisons.</strong> Use the same
prompts and seeds across policies to reduce variance.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Invest in oracle quality.</strong> A well-chosen,
representative oracle slice (150–200 samples) is the foundation of
reliable calibration.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Check diagnostics before shipping.</strong> Coverage,
ESS, reliability, and share catch most issues. Always inspect
them.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Report CIs with OUA.</strong> Honest intervals that
include calibrator uncertainty build trust and prevent
overconfidence.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Run sensitivity checks.</strong> Cohort restriction,
trimming, and alternative calibrators confirm robustness and flag
fragility.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Document everything.</strong> Judge config, prompt
sampling, oracle slice, estimator choice, and diagnostic results.
Reproducibility matters.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Iterate.</strong> Use CJE diagnostics to guide data
collection: add labels where coverage is thin, improve the judge where
reliability is poor, collect fresh draws where ESS is low.</p></li>
</ol>

<h2>Future directions</h2>
<p>Ongoing and future work includes:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Sequential and adaptive evaluation:</strong> Extensions
for multi-turn conversations and adaptive prompting.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Multi-objective optimization:</strong> Methods for
evaluating trade-offs across multiple KPIs.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Online integration:</strong> Combining CJE with bandit
algorithms for continuous policy improvement.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Fairness and robustness:</strong> Ensuring unbiased
estimates across demographic groups and robust to adversarial
prompts.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Meta-learning for calibration:</strong> Using historical
evaluations to improve calibration on new domains.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Acknowledgments</h2>
<p>CJE builds on decades of work in causal inference, importance
sampling, doubly robust estimation, and calibration. Key intellectual
debts include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Doubly robust methods (Robins, Rotnitzky, Scharfstein; Bang,
Robins; Chernozhukov et al.).</p></li>
<li><p>Importance sampling and overlap diagnostics (Hirano, Imbens,
Ridder; Li, Sävje, Sussman).</p></li>
<li><p>Isotonic regression and calibration (Zadrozny, Elkan; Platt; Guo
et al.).</p></li>
<li><p>Influence functions and semiparametric efficiency (van der Laan,
Robins).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This playbook synthesizes these methods into a practitioner-first
toolkit for LLM evaluation.</p>

<h2>Final thoughts</h2>
<p>LLM-as-judge evaluation is here to stay. As models improve, so do the
stakes: small differences in policy performance can translate to large
impacts at scale. CJE provides a rigorous, transparent, and practical
framework for making these decisions with confidence.</p>
<p>The diagnostics are not gatekeepers—they are guides. When diagnostics
pass, trust the estimate. When they fail, use the fixes. When fixes
don’t work, report the limitations and proceed with caution (or
regenerate).</p>
<p>Evaluation is not a one-shot activity. It’s a loop: design, collect,
calibrate, diagnose, remediate, report, and iterate. CJE is designed to
support that loop with minimal friction and maximum transparency.</p>
<p>We hope this playbook serves as a practical companion for teams
building and deploying LLMs. For questions, contributions, or feedback,
